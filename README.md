#### Due to heroku free terms, if an app receives no web traffic in a 30-minute period, it will sleep. Therefore, during the first launch, the application may take longer to load than usual, approximately 15 - 20 seconds. So please be patient and wait for the app to launch. Subsequent launches will be relatively fast.
